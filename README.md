# What THISSSS?

This is a personal project that uses an unofficial Apex Legends Api in order to get the match history from a play in Apex Legends. (https://apexlegendsapi.com/)

# Note

In order for it to work you must have to be whitelisted!

Also you will need an api key and you will have to paste it in the config in the API variable.

# What if it doesn't work?

The developer keeps working on his api, adding stuff, changing etc.. & I'm not gonna update it.
