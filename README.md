# What's this project?

This is a personal project that uses an unofficial Apex Legends Api in order to get the match history from a play in Apex Legends. (https://apexlegendsapi.com/)

# What do I need for it in order to work?

1. Your API must be whitelisted
2. You will need an api key and you will have to paste it in the config file under the API variable
3. In order to track a player's match history you need to add them in the players.json file under their platfrom

# What if it doesn't work?

The developer keeps working on his api, adding stuff, changing etc.. so if something doesn't work it's because of that and because I am not gonna update update this project.

VS CODE PROBLEM - On my machine VS Code was not able to work; that doesn't mean that it won't work on your though - FIX - In case it doesn't work you can use another IDE I simply used Sublime Text

# Q&A

1. Is there a way to track switch players? - YES, the developer had updated the api so that you can track switch players. -Documentation: https://apexlegendsapi.com/documentation.php
